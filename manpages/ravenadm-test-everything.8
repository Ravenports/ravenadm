.Sh NAME
.Nm "ravenadm test-everything"
.Nd force build entire tree with developer checks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is the equivalent of passing a list of every single port in the
Ravenports tree to the
.Xr ravenadm-test 8
command.
.Sh NOTES
Rather than linearly scanning the ports tree as is done by the
.Em ravenadm test
command, this command will split the tree into equal-size lists and feed
these lists to individual scanners that all work in parallel.
